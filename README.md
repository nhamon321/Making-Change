# Making-Change
This is a program that helps a cashier make change. The program gets a dollar amount from the user 
and calculates and displays how to make the change using the smallest number of bills and coins possible. 
(The change should be made by first giving the maximum number of dollars, followed by the maximum number of 
quarters, then dimes, nickels, and finally pennies. i.e. Your answer should never have more than 3 quarters, 
2 dimes, 1 nickel, or 4 pennies.) You may assume that only amounts greater than $0 will be entered.
